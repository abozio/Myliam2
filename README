About
-----

LIAM 2 is a tool to develop (different kinds of) microsimulation models.

Goal
----

The goal of the project is to let modellers concentrate on what is strictly specific to their model without having to worry about the technical details. This is achieved by providing a generic microsimulation toolbox which is not tied to a particular model. By making it available for free, our hope is to greatly reduce the development costs (in terms of both time and money) of microsimulation models. The toolbox is made as generic as possible so that it can be used to develop almost any microsimulation model as long as it use cross-sectional ageing, ie all individuals are simulated at the same time for one period, then for the next period, etc.
