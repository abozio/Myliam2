LIAM 2 bundle
-------------

The bundle includes:

- The executable.

- A text editor (Notepad++), pre-configured to work with LIAM2 models.

  * Notepad++ is a free (and open source) text editor that is available
    at http://sourceforge.net/projects/notepad-plus/.
    
  * We pre-configured it so that you can import csv files and run your models
    directly from within the editor by simply pressing F5 or F6 respectively.
    See below for more information.
    
- The documentation in html, pdf and chm (windows help) format.

- A demonstration model with a synthetic data set of 20,200 persons grouped in
  14,700 households.

Getting Started
---------------

- Copy the contents of the bundle in a directory on your disk (let's call it 
  *\\localpath\\*).

- Run the "Notepad++Portable.exe" from the *\\localpath\\Liam2Suite\\editor* 
  directory.

- Open a model (eg. \\localpath\\Liam2Suite\\examples\\demo01.yml)

- Press F6 to run the model. A console window will open within the editor and
  display the status of the simulation. After the simulation completes, the
  console window becomes interactive.

- Use this console to explore the results.

Using your own data
-------------------

- Prepare your data as CSV files. The first row should contain the name of the
  fields. You need at least two integer columns: "id" and "period" (though they
  do not necessarily need to be named like that in the csv file).

- Create an import file, as described in the :ref:`import_data` section. You
  can use \\localpath\\Liam2Suite\\examples\\demo_import.yml as an example.

- Press F5 to convert your CSV files to hdf5.

- Use the newly created data file with your model.
