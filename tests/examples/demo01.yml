# This is a "simulation" file. To run the simulation, press F6 in liam2
# environment, or run the following command in a console:
# INSTALL PATH\liam2 run demo01.yml

# This first example demonstrates how to define a simple entity with a few
# fields and some processes. We will use the following functions:
# if, trunc, csv, show, dump and groupby
entities:
    person:
        fields:
            # period and id are implicit
            - age:    int
            - gender: bool

            # fields not present in input
            - agegroup: {type: int, initialdata: false}

        # possible transitions and regressions. The actual list used in the
        # simulation must be defined below
        processes:
            age: age + 1
            agegroup: if(age < 50,
                         5 * trunc(age / 5),
                         10 * trunc(age / 10))

            # produces 2 csv files (one per period): "person_20xx.csv"
            dump_info: csv(dump(id, age, gender))
            show_demography: show(groupby(agegroup, gender))

simulation:
    processes:
        - person: [age, agegroup, dump_info, show_demography]

    input:
        file: simple2001.h5
    output:
        file: simulation.h5

    # first simulated period
    start_period: 2002
    periods: 2
