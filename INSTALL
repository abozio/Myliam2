Installation
------------

* First install Python:

- Python 2.7.x (either 32 bits or 64 bits version): 
  http://www.python.org/download/releases/

Alexis : until now, I worked with 32-bits version, I would be pleased if someone try the 64.

Make sure both PYTHONDIR and PYTHONDIR\Scripts is in your system PATH
   where PYTHONDIR is the directory where you installed Python

* Then you need to install all our other dependencies (third-party packages for
Python). If you are on Windows, the easiest way to install them is to use the
(unoffical) binary packages from Christoph Gohlke at: 

  http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/

Third party packages:

For the Liam2 part : 

- Numpy 1.7.0 or later (for your version of python): 
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/

- PyTables 2.2.1 or later (for your version of python):
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/pytables/files/pytables/
  
- Numexpr 2.0 or later (for your version of python):
  http://code.google.com/p/numexpr/downloads/
  
- PyYAML 3.0.8 or later (for your version of python):
  http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML
  
- carray 0.4 or later (for your version of python):  
  http://carray.pytables.org/download/


For the OpenFisca part: 

latest version of : 
- scipy
- pandas
- rpy2
- PyQt4
- dateutil
- distribute
- openpyxl
- matplotlib
- pywin32
- ipython


Optional dependencies:

- Cython 0.16 or later (needed to build the C extensions, see below).
  http://www.cython.org/
  
- Sphinx 1.0 or later (to "build" the documentation to html, or pdf) 
  http://www.sphinx-doc.org/

- ViTables 2.1 or later (to "see" tables in h5 format) 
  http://vitables.org/


* Install R
  http://cran.r-project.org/
  
  Important, you must add two keys to your "variables d'environnement"       (right-click on computer then -> properties -> advanced system parameter ->   variables d'environnement : the first one is R_HOME with your path to R (in   my case it's C:\Program Files\R\R-2.15.1) the second one R_USER with your   name (Alexis in my case, nice to meet you). 

* Install notepad++
  The best way to install notepad to run our YAML file, is to download Liam2   source code (http://liam2.plan.be/). A bundle is included alredy configured   to run YAML code of Liam2.  

* Install Aptana Studio 3 
  http://www.aptana.com/products/studio3

  You can then import project you want. For example, you can import the     previous file downloaded from liam2.plan.be as a new PyDev project. 

   If you want to use git from Aptana, go to Help -> Install new software
In the work with section add github - http://download.eclipse.org/egit/updates
Then download Egit (and Egit-Source I don't know which one of them I use). 

   I suggest also to install github (https://github.com/) and to create an account on it. 



Building the C extensions
-------------------------

Additionally, if you want to get maximum performance, you will also need to
build the C extensions. This is optional but recommended.

For that you need to have cython (see above) and a C compiler installed, then
go to the src/ directory of LIAM2 and type:

  python setup.py build_ext --inplace

If all goes according to plan, you should then be up and running.

Building the documentation
--------------------------

0) make sure both PYTHONDIR and PYTHONDIR\Scripts is in your system PATH
   where PYTHONDIR is the directory where you installed Python

1) Install sphinx 
2) Open a command prompt 
3) Go to the documentation directory. For example:
 
  cd liam2\doc\usersguide\

3) Launch the build: 

  make html

4) Open the result in your favourite web browser. It is located in:
  
  build/html/index.html


Launching ViTables
-------------------------

I don't know how to run it simply. The solution I use is to run the viewer.py file which I let on my desktop (open with python.exe).
